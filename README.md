# U.S. Accident Data Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of U.S. road accident data using Python. It includes loading a large dataset, performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insightful visualizations to understand accident trends and severity.

## 📝 Project Summary

The notebook analyzes a U.S. accident dataset obtained from a public source. The main objectives of this analysis are:

- To explore the distribution and severity of accidents across different U.S. states.
- To identify temporal patterns (by hour, day, month) in accident occurrences.
- To evaluate how weather, visibility, and other environmental factors affect accident severity.
- To create interactive visualizations (e.g., heat maps, bar charts) that clearly communicate insights.

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed

- **Data Loading and Inspection**: Loaded a large CSV dataset, inspected for nulls, shape, and types.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and reduced the dataset for efficient processing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed accident severity distribution
  - Examined top states with the most accidents
  - Studied time-based trends (hourly, daily, monthly)
- **Geographical Visualization**:
  - Created a choropleth heat map to visualize accident count per state.
- **Weather Analysis**:
  - Compared accident severity with visibility and weather condition data.
